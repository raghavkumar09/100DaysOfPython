#   Python f-string is the newest Python syntax to do string formatting. It is available since Python 3.6.  
#   Python f-strings provide a faster, more readable, more concise, and less error prone way of formatting    
#   strings in Python.

#   The f-strings have the f prefix and use {} brackets to evaluate values.

#   Example

score = 0                       # it is a integer
height =6.6                     # it is a floating point
isWinning = True                # it is boolien

# print all value in one line

print(f"Your score is {score}, Your height is {height}, Your are right {isWinning}")
